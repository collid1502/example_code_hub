# Detention Tracker

Created a simple excel tool for a school teacher friend, who wanted a way to create a detention tracker they could use each school term. They wanted automatic creation fo daily tabs, which had certain dropdown fields etc. built in / automatic data population based on formulas. They also wanted a rolling tab, that could copy data from all sheets to one master sheet at the end for some general analysis.

Here's a picture:
