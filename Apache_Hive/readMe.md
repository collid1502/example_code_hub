# Apache Hive

A data warehouse software project built on top of Hadoop for providing data query & analysis.
Hive provides an SQL-like interface (HQL) to query data stored in various databases & file systems 
that integrate with Hadoop.

HiveQL and Spark SQL are (mostly) cross compatible. a HQL query should work in Spark SQL & vice versa.
