# Example Code Hub Project

**Author** : `Dan Collins`

**Details**<br>
This repository is designed to cover a variety of coding examples & "how-to" guides that I have built up over time for a variety of langauges & tools (within the Data & Analytics space)

**Included**:<br>

- `Apache Impala`: Example scripts of the in-memory processing query tool (SQL query engine) for data stored on Hadoop/HDFS
- `Apache Hive`: HiveQL is similar to SQL, & utilises Hadoop Map-Reduce for big data operations on Hadoop/HDFS
- `Bash`: Command line language for Linux. Ability to complete standard tasks that could be achieved through point & click for example
- `Batch`: Running Windows CMD scripts
- `Diagrams`: Example pattern diagrams built using tools like Draw.io
- `Docker`: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
- `HDFS Shell`: Example commands for HDFS CLI, such as killing applications via YARN, copying from local folders to HDFS etc. 
- `Python`: general python programming, used within Data Analysis, Engineering and other tasks
- `Remote Dev`: Example for setting up remote development from laptop to AWS, accessing greater compute power when needed
- `SAS`: Base SAS langauge, covering DATA STEPS, PROC SQL, MACRO, LOOPS, import/export, reading flat files etc. 
- `Scala`: Statically typed language, and also the base language for Apache Spark. Some examples of spark-shell scripts, creating methods, JARs etc.
- `Spark`: Apache Sparkâ„¢ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
- `SQL`: Standard SQL scripts & common tasks/queries such as joins, sub queries, window functions, aggregations, CTEs, traditional RDBMS (*Postgres etc.*), cloud data-warehouses (*Snowflake*) examples etc.
- `Terraform`: An infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change and version control cloud & on-premise resources safely & efficiently
- `VBA`: Visual Basic for Applications. The programming language for MS Excel.
