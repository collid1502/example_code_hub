# Example Code Hub

**Author** : `Dan Collins`

**Details**<br>
This repository is designed to cover a variety of coding examples & "how-to" guides that I have built up over time for a variety of langauges & tools (within the Data & Analytics space)

**Included**:<br>

- `Apache Impala`: Example scripts of the in-memory processing query tool (SQL query engine) for data stored on Hadoop/HDFS

- `HDFS Shell`: Example commands for HDFS CLI, such as killing applications via YARN, copying from local folders to HDFS etc. 
- `Python` : general python programming, use of popular packages likes Pandas, Numpy, Requests, PySpark, PyDeequ 
- `SAS`: Base SAS langauge, covering DATA STEPS, PROC SQL, MACRO, LOOPS, import/export, reading flat files etc. 
- `Scala`: Statically typed language, and also the base language for Apache Spark. Some examples of spark-shell scripts, creating methods, JARs etc.
